### About

QBronze is a one-week online workshop on the basics of quantum computing and quantum programming based on the introductory material Bronze prepared by QWorld. The scope of the workshop covers preliminaries of quantum computing, implementation of basic quantum protocols, and algorithms. Bronze is a task-based tutorial consisting of around 30 Jupyter notebooks. 

### Content

Bronze uses Qiskit framework as the quantum programming language. Each notebook consists of some theoretical background about the subject, and programming tasks. While it seems like a quantum programming tutorial, quantum computing concepts are eventually taught through programming.

The content is divided into 5 sections. <br />
– Basics of classical systems <br />
– Basics of quantum systems <br />
– Quantum operators on a real-valued qubit <br />
– Quantum correlation <br />
– Grover’s search algorithm <br />

The tutorial starts with classical and probabilistic systems and the quantum concepts are introduced gradually. Bronze does not involve any complex numbers which facilitates the learning process and allows visualization of states and gates in 2D plane. After introducing the basic concepts like superposition and entanglement, superdense coding and quantum teleportation protocols come forward. Subjects like phase kickback, controlled operations, and multiple qubits serve as a preliminary for the last section, Grover’s search algorithm.

### Schedule

The workshop will be running in two different time zones (18:00-22:00 Paris Time (UTC+1) and 18:00-22:00 Tokyo Time (UTC+9). Each day, there will be a live session at 18:00 about the previous day’s content and participants will have a chance to ask their questions. After the live session, participants will be working on their own on the day’s material while getting help from the mentors in the Discord channel. The topics to be covered each day by the participants is given below:

Day 1: Welcome meeting and basics of classical systems <br />
Day 2: Basics of quantum systems, visualization, superposition and measurement, quantum operators on a (real-valued) qubit <br />
Day 3: Two qubits, phase kickback, multiple qubit constructions <br />
Day 4: Entanglement and superdense coding, quantum teleportation <br />
Day 5: Grover’s Search <br />
Day 6: Closing remarks <br />
